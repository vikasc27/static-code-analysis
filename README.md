1.## 🎯 Objective
To enhance Python code quality, security, and style by using **static analysis tools** — Pylint, Bandit, and Flake8 — to detect and fix common programming issues.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **Pylint** – checks code quality and logical errors.  
- **Flake8** – enforces Python style guide (PEP 8).  
- **Bandit** – identifies common security issues in Python code.
